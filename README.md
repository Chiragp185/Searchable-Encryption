# Searchable-Encryption
An implementation of the research paper "A New Secure and Lightweight Searchable Encryption Scheme over Encrypted Cloud Data"

Cloud computing is on-demand, over the internet access to computing resources. Cloud storage services help users eliminate spending on storage devices and instead store data over the cloud. 

Data is encrypted for maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Searchable Encryption is a symmetric encryption scheme that allows users to search the encrypted data as it is rather than downloading all the files and decrypting them. 

I present a novel rank-based encryption scheme in this paper which utilizes a probabilistic trapdoor that can facilitate searches. They are generated by exploiting the properties of the modular inverse. Probabilistic trapdoors also address passive attacks that can make this scheme more secure. New definitions for indistinguishability are proposed which must be fulfilled for ensuring privacy.

This algorithm consists of five phases: Π = (KeyGen, Build_Index, Build_Trap, Search_Outcome, Dec) 

1) (𝐾, 𝑘𝑠 , 𝑝) ← KeyGen(1 𝜆 ): is a probabilistic key generation algorithm. The algorithm takes a security parameter λ as input and returns a master key K, a session key 𝑘𝑠 and a prime number 𝑝.

2) (𝐼) ← Build_Index(𝐾,𝐷): is a deterministic algorithm to generate an index table 𝐼. The algorithm takes a master key K and a collection of documents D to be outsourced to the CS as input. The algorithm returns a secure index 𝐼.

3) 𝑇𝑤 ← Build_Trap(𝐾,𝑘𝑠 , 𝑤,num): is a probabilistic algorithm. The algorithm requires the master key 𝐾, a session key 𝑘𝑠 , keyword w and the number (num) of documents D required as the input. The algorithm returns a trapdoor 𝑇𝑤.

4) 𝑋 ← Search_Outcome(𝑘𝑠 ,𝐼, 𝑇𝑤): is a deterministic algorithm run by the CS. The algorithm takes the session key 𝑘𝑠 , index table 𝐼 and the trapdoor (𝑇𝑤) as the input and returns X, a set of desired document identifiers encrypted 𝐸𝑛𝑐𝐾(𝑖𝑑(𝐷𝑖 )) containing the keyword 𝑤 in ranked order.

5) 𝐷𝑖 ← Dec(𝐾, 𝑋): is a deterministic algorithm run by the client. The algorithm takes the client’s master key and encrypted set of document identifier.

I have implemented all these algorithms in Java. A graphical user interface has been added by using Java AWT and Java Swing components for ease of use.
