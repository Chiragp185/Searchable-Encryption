# Searchable-Encryption
An implementation of the research paper "A New Secure and Lightweight Searchable Encryption Scheme over Encrypted Cloud Data"

Cloud computing is on-demand, over the internet access to computing resources. Cloud storage services help users eliminate spending on storage devices and instead store data over the cloud. 

Data is encrypted for maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Searchable Encryption is a symmetric encryption scheme that allows users to search the encrypted data as it is rather than downloading all the files and decrypting them. 

 We present a novel rank-based encryption scheme in this paper which utilizes a probabilistic trapdoor that can facilitate searches. They are generated by exploiting the properties of the modular inverse. Probabilistic trapdoors also address passive attacks that can make this scheme more secure. New definitions for indistinguishability are proposed which must be fulfilled for ensuring privacy.
